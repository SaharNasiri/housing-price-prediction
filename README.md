# Housing Prices Optimization

Understanding the Client and their Problem

- Client Housebuyer: This client wants to find their next dream home with a reasonable price tag. They have their locations of interest ready.
- Client Houseseller: This client wants to take advantage of the features that influence a house price the most. They typically want to buy a house at a low price and invest on the features that will give the highest return. 

Goal: predicting the final price for each house using advanced regression techniques.
